        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <p>Chapter 1 kicked off Fortnite’s story with a simple island that quickly became a stage for epic events. From
            meteors and mysterious rifts to floating islands and the iconic black hole finale, each season added new
            locations, characters, and surprises. This was the start of a world that changes, evolves, and keeps players
            guessing—<em>every battle could shape the story.</em></p>

        <h2>Season 1 — “First Steps” (Oct 2017 – Dec 2017)</h2>
        <p>Fortnite Battle Royale launched into public view during Season 1 as a raw, open sandbox: a 100-player
            last-man-standing mode with a simple island, a handful of named locations, and almost no narrative framing
            built into the game. There were no cinematic live events or a running storyline yet — Season 1 was mostly
            about establishing the mode, introducing the first Battle Pass concept (rudimentary compared to later
            seasons), and letting the playerbase explore, drop into POIs, and invent emergent stories on their own.
            Because the game was new, most early “lore” was community-made theory rather than developer-driven
            narrative.</p>

        <h2>Season 2 — “Fort Knights” (Dec 2017 – Feb 2018)</h2>
        <p>Season 2 introduced a clear theme (medieval/knights) and the idea that seasons would be stylized, themed
            experiences. The season’s Battle Pass and themed skins pushed cosmetic storytelling forward, and Epic began
            treating each season as a contained aesthetic chapter. Season 2 also started the cadence of mid-season map
            tweaks and smaller reveals (for example, Tilted Towers was added around this early period), showing Epic’s
            willingness to change the island between seasons rather than only at big events.</p>

        <h2>Season 3 — “Meteor Strike” (Feb 2018 – Apr 2018)</h2>
        <p>Season 3 turned attention to a larger, unfolding mystery: a meteor was first spotted in the sky, and players
            began tracking its slow descent. Season 3’s space/sci-fi aesthetic (space skins, astronaut motifs) paired
            with subtle in-game clues (shooting stars and the visible meteor) seeded a multi-season arc. The meteor’s
            presence set up Season 4’s payoff — Epic was now using season-long teasers to hint at in-game changes rather
            than only cosmetics.</p>

        <h2>Season 4 — “Brace for Impact” (May 2018 – Jul 2018)</h2>
        <p>Season 4 delivered the meteor payoff. The meteor — long foreshadowed during Season 3 — crashed into the
            island and destroyed Dusty Depot, creating one of the first major, permanent map changes and ushering in a
            narrative turn: the Visitor (an enigmatic astronaut-like character) was revealed to be connected to the
            rocket and meteor story. Epic staged a live rocket launch event (a landmark moment for Fortnite) that opened
            rifts in the sky and showed the game could produce scripted, cinematic events that visibly altered the
            world. That rocket and its rifts would be referred to in later seasons as part of a building multiseason
            mythology.</p>

        <h2>Season 5 — “Worlds Collide” (Jul 2018 – Sep 2018)</h2>
        <p>Season 5 leaned into the idea that the island was being affected by outside forces. The “Crack in the Sky”
            and rift phenomena brought in whole new biomes and POIs from different realities — desert regions, a
            revamped race track, and odd insertions of items and landmarks that didn’t quite belong. This was the start
            of a more kaleidoscopic story-telling approach: different realities and timelines bleeding together.
            Notably, late in Season 5 a mysterious cube (later nicknamed “Kevin the Cube” by the community) formed and
            began to roll around the island, leaving glyphs and corruption in its wake — a behavior that would directly
            trigger Season 6’s events.</p>

        <h2>Season 6 — “Darkness Rises” (Sep 2018 – Dec 2018)</h2>
        <p>Season 6 was dominated by cube lore. The cube sank into Loot Lake at the end of Season 5 and re-emerged to
            lift the lake’s central island into the air, creating the iconic Floating Island. Over the season the cube
            interacted with rune/glyph sites across the map, corrupted areas, and spawned Cube Monsters and “shadow”
            phenomena. Fortnitemares (the Halloween event) escalated the cube story: the cube’s instability culminated
            in a dramatic on-map event (the “Butterfly Event”) where the cube’s outer shell melted and exploded, players
            briefly experienced a liminal “In-Between” sequence, and the map was reshaped when fragments of the floating
            island fell back into Loot Lake. Season 6 solidified animal, cosmic, and supernatural throughlines in the
            lore.</p>

        <h2>Season 7 — “You Better Watch Out” (Dec 2018 – Feb 2019)</h2>
        <p>Season 7 brought a sweeping winter invasion: a massive iceberg appeared on the horizon and collided with the
            island, blanketing large areas in snow and creating Polar Peak and new winter POIs. The Ice King and an
            accompanying winter storyline introduced new characters and staged an “Ice Storm” that threatened the
            island; elements of the cube’s influence and the island’s earlier disruptions threaded into this frosty arc
            (for instance, shards and eggs hidden in Polar Peak hinted at deeper, continuing mysteries). Season 7 mixed
            holiday/event content with slow-burn lore, continuing Epic’s pattern of coupling seasonal gameplay changes
            with story seeds.</p>

        <h2>Season 8 — “X Marks the Spot” (Feb 2019 – May 2019)</h2>
        <p>Season 8 leaned into adventure and island-scale upheaval: a volcano emerged, pirate ships and cannons
            appeared, and earthquakes began to rumble through the map. Lore threads converged — the thawing iceberg,
            underground disturbances, and the volcano’s rise all combined to create large-scale destruction (notably the
            volcano would later destroy Tilted Towers). Season 8 mixed playful pirate themes with the sense that the
            island’s physical fabric was still unstable after the cube events and earlier rifts.</p>

        <h2>Season 9 — “The Future Is Yours” (May 2019 – Aug 2019)</h2>
        <p>Season 9 took an ambitious tonal pivot toward a near-future, sci-fi makeover: locations destroyed by the
            volcano were rebuilt as futuristic equivalents — Tilted became Neo Tilted, Retail Row became Mega Mall —
            driven in-lore by the Zero Point’s influence and advanced tech. The season also introduced the Mecha Team
            Leader (a giant mech built to fight the Devourer — a monstrous creature that had been released) and staged
            large set-pieces where Mecha battled the Devourer in a cinematic moment. The Zero Point (the mysterious
            energy at the heart of many storylines) grew more central as lore currency and a driver for map-and-story
            transformations.</p>

        <h2>Season X — “Out of Time” (Aug 1, 2019 – Oct 13, 2019)</h2>
        <p>Season X was Chapter 1’s finale and explicitly embraced temporal chaos. The season’s “Out of Time” motif
            manifested as rift zones that pulled in older POIs, alternate realities, and time-displaced locations — Epic
            literally stitched past map eras back onto the island. The Scientist (tied to a mysterious organization
            later referred to as the Seven) and other meta-figures became prominent in the lore: rift zones, volatile
            time anomalies, and a reunited meteor all played into a final sequence. Everything culminated in “The End”
            live event on October 13, 2019: a rocket launch, rifts, and the unfrozen meteor converged on the Zero Point
            and created a black hole that swallowed the island — the game client went dark and players experienced the
            now-infamous black hole and "konami-code" minigame in the downtime that followed. That event closed Chapter
            1 and set the stage for Chapter 2’s fresh start.</p>
